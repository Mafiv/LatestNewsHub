# News App

This is a simple news app built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The app fetches news from the GNews API and displays them in a list.

The app is built using the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Vite: A modern web development build tool that provides a fast development experience
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom user interfaces

The app also uses the following plugins:

- @vitejs/plugin-react: A Vite plugin that uses Babel for Fast Refresh
- @vitejs/plugin-react-swc: A Vite plugin that uses SWC for Fast Refresh

The app uses the following dependencies:

- axios: A popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests
- @tanstack/react-query: A library for managing data fetching and caching in React applications
- eslint-plugin-react: A plugin for ESLint that provides rules for React applications
- tailwindcss: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom user interfaces

The app is configured to use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting.

The app is also configured to use a custom font, "Arvo", which is a serif font that is used for headings and titles.

The app has a simple layout with a header, a main section, and a footer. The main section contains a list of news items, each with a title, a description, and a link to the source of the news item.

The app also has a simple routing system, with three routes: "/", "/economy", and "/technology". The "/" route displays the latest news, the "/economy" route displays the latest economic news, and the "/technology" route displays the latest technology news.

The app is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
